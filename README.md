The Training Logger is a full-stack web application designed to help users log gym, BJJ, and wrestling sessions. It supports two complementary logging systems: strength training (sets, reps,weight) and grappling techniques (drills, sparring, submissions, positional focus). The app provides progression analytics, search, and export/sharing features. It will be deployed on AWS on my custom sub-domain: train.deepblacksea.net.
